# Data Science for Psychologists (ds4psy)

<!-- Description: --> 

All datasets and functions required for the examples and exercises of the book "Data Science for Psychologists" (by Hansjoerg Neth, Konstanz University, 2021), available at <https://bookdown.org/hneth/ds4psy/>. The book and course introduce principles and methods of data science to students of psychology and other biological or social sciences. The 'ds4psy' package primarily provides datasets, but also functions for data generation and manipulation (e.g., of text and time data) and graphics that are used in the book and its exercises. All functions included in 'ds4psy' are designed to be explicit and instructive, rather than efficient or elegant. 


### Overview {-}

The book and course [Data Science for Psychologists](https://bookdown.org/hneth/ds4psy/) includes the following resources:

# ds4psy 0.7.0

<!-- Log of changes: --> 

This version adds functionality, increases modularity, and fixes a bug in text data. [2021-05-12] 

Changes since last release: 


## Major changes 

- Breaking change: The function `read_ascii()` was split into 2\ parts (to enable independent access to their functionality): 

    1. A new `read_ascii()` version reads text (from file or user input) into a character string;  
    2. A new `map_text_coord()` function converts a text string into a table of individual characters (with x/y-coordinates).  

<!-- Add blank line. --> 

- Added `plot_chars()` for plotting characters of text and visualizing pattern matches (specified as regular expressions) by highlighting labels (color/angle) or background tiles (color). The function uses 2\ auxiliary functions: 

    1. `map_text_regex()` adds pattern matching options (for colors and angles) to `map_text_coord()`.  
    2. `plot_charmap()` plots character maps as text and tile plots (with aesthetics for labels and tiles).  

<!-- Add blank line. --> 

- Added `count_chars_words()` for counting the frequency of both characters and words in text strings.  


## Minor changes 

- added `plot_mar` argument to `theme_empty()` 
- added functionality to `plot_text()` (but see `plot_chars()`) 
- added utility functions for locating, identifying, and assigning vectors (of color/angle maps) to text strings matching a pattern 
- added `text_to_chars()` and related functions for converting character strings (e.g., text to characters, preserving spaces) 
- added utility functions for counting the frequency of characters and words in text strings 
- renamed `is_vector()` to `is_vect()` as `is_vector()` function is defined by the **purrr** package 


## Details 

- signal deprecation status in `plot_text()`   
- bug fix: removed marked UTF-8 strings from `Trumpisms` 


## ToDo  

Changes to be implemented prior to next release: 

- Split the mixed functionality of `plot_text()` into 2 functions:  

    1. Combine `count_chars_words()` with `map_text_coord()` or `map_text_regex()` 
    to create a df with 2 color vectors (fg/bg) based on `char_freq` and/or `word_freq`  

    2. `plot_charmap()` directly plots the resulting df.

# ds4psy 0.5.0

Release of **ds4psy** (0.5.0) [on CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ds4psy) 
adds and revises functionality, updates data, and fixes bugs. [2020-09-01] 

Changes since last release:

## Major changes 

- Additional functions for **dates** and **times**:

    - added `diff_dates()` to compute temporal differences between dates (in human time units of years, months, and days) 
    - added `diff_times()` to compute temporal differences between times (in human time units of years, ..., and seconds) 
    - added `diff_tz()` to compute time difference based on time zone differences  
    - added `days_in_month()` to obtain number of days in months for given dates (accounting for leap years)  

<!-- Add blank line.  --> 

- added `is_equal()` and `num_equal()` to check pairwise (near) equality of vectors  
- added `theme_clean()` as an alternative to `theme_ds4psy()`  

## Minor changes 

- renamed `is.wholenumber()` to `is_wholenumber()`  
- revised arguments of `sample_date()` and `sample_time()` to align with `sample()` 
- revised `theme_ds4psy()` to provide control over colors of backgrounds, lines, and text elements 
- updated `fame` data  

<!-- Add blank line.  --> 

## Details 

- bug fix: `num_as_char()` now also works for negative numbers.  
- bug fix: Remove alternative solution in `is_leap_year()` (which yielded `FALSE` for `NA` inputs).  
- bug fix: Replace `\u2212` (minus sign) by `-` (dash) in `exp_num_dt$blood_type` to prevent **Note** on "marked UTF-8 strings".

# ds4psy 0.4.0

Release of **ds4psy** (0.4.0) [on CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ds4psy) 
adds new functionality and fixes minor bugs. [2020-07-06] 

Changes since last release:

## Major changes 

- This version adds support for processing data with **dates** and **times**:   

    - simple date and time functions now include options for returning dates or times, rather than strings.
    - added time zone support to various functions.
    - added datasets with date and time variables. 

<!-- Add blank line.  --> 

## Minor changes 

- `change_tz()` and `change_time()` functions for changing the display of calendar times ("POSIXct") to local times ("POSIXlt") in different time zones `tz`, and vice versa (i.e., changing actual time, but preserving time display).  
- `is_leap_year()` function checks dates and times (or integers denoting years in 4-digit "%Y" format) for falling within a leap year.  
- data in `dt_10` and `exp_num_dt` support exercises on dates and times.  
- `cur_date()` and `cur_time()` now print date/time (as string) or return a "Date"/"POSIXct" object.  
- `what_date()` and `what_time()` gain support for adding time zones `tz` (but no active conversion).  
- `sample_time()`: Switch default to sampling "POSIXct" objects (making "POSIXlt" optional) and allow specifying time zones `tz`.   
- All date and time functions based primarily on dates (`cur_date()`, `what_date()`, etc.) now use `Sys.Date()` (i.e., an object of class "Date") rather than `Sys.time()` (i.e., a "POSIXct" calendar time) as default.  

## Details 

- bug fix: Distinguish `is.wholenumber()` from `is.integer()`  
- bug fix: Use `\u...` rather than `\U...` in `Umlaut` definitions  
- bug fix: Removed non-ASCII characters from `fruits` and `flowery`
