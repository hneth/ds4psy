**Welcome** to the R package **ds4psy** &mdash; a software companion to the book and course<br/>
[Data Science for Psychologists](https://bookdown.org/hneth/ds4psy/).   

This R package provides datasets and functions used in the book and course. 
Its source code is hosted at <https://github.com/hneth/ds4psy>. 

The book and course introduce the principles and methods of data science for students of psychology and other biological or social sciences. 
The book is available at <https://bookdown.org/hneth/ds4psy/>. 


## Description

The **ds4psy** book and course provide an introduction to data science that is tailored to the needs of psychologists, but is also suitable for students of the humanities and other biological or social sciences. 
This audience typically has some knowledge of statistics, but rarely an idea how data is prepared and shaped to allow for statistical testing. 
By using various data types and working with many examples, we teach tools for transforming, summarizing, and visualizing data. By keeping our eyes open for the perils of misleading representations, the book fosters fundamental skills of data literacy and cultivates reproducible research practices that enable and precede any practical use of statistics. 

The R package **ds4psy** primarily provides datasets, but also functions for data generation and manipulation (e.g., of text and time data) and graphics that are used in the book and its exercises. All functions included in **ds4psy** are designed to be instructive and entertaining, rather than elegant or efficient. 


## Installation
