\description{
\code{falsePosPsy_all} is a dataset containing the data from 2 studies designed to 
highlight problematic research practices within psychology.
}
\details{
Simmons, Nelson and Simonsohn (2011) published a controversial article 
with a necessarily false finding. By conducting simulations and 2 simple behavioral experiments, 
the authors show that flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting 
dramatically increases the rate of false-positive findings.
