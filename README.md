# Data Science for Psychologists (ds4psy)

Welcome to the R package **ds4psy** — a software companion to the book
and course</br> [Data Science for
Psychologists](https://bookdown.org/hneth/ds4psy/).

This R package provides datasets and functions used in the [ds4psy
book](https://bookdown.org/hneth/ds4psy/) and course. The book and
course introduce the principles and methods of data science for students
of psychology and other biological or social sciences.

<!-- Description of ds4psy package:  -->
<!-- All datasets and functions required for the examples and exercises of the book "Data Science for Psychologists" (by Hansjoerg Neth, Konstanz University, 2022), available at <https://bookdown.org/hneth/ds4psy/>. The book and course introduce principles and methods of data science to students of psychology and other biological or social sciences. The 'ds4psy' package primarily provides datasets, but also functions for data generation and manipulation (e.g., of text and time data) and graphics that are used in the book and its exercises. All functions included in 'ds4psy' are designed to be explicit and instructive, rather than efficient or elegant.  -->

## Installation

The current release of **ds4psy** is available from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/) at
<https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ds4psy>:

``` r
install.packages('ds4psy')  # install ds4psy from CRAN client
library('ds4psy')           # load to use the package
```

The current development version of **ds4psy** can be installed from its
[GitHub](https://github.com) repository at
<https://github.com/hneth/ds4psy/>:

``` r
# install.packages('devtools')  # (if not installed yet)
devtools::install_github('hneth/ds4psy')
library('ds4psy')  # load to use the package
```

The most recent version of the [ds4psy
book](https://bookdown.org/hneth/ds4psy/) is available at
<https://bookdown.org/hneth/ds4psy/>.

## Description

This book and course provide an introduction to data science that is
tailored to the needs of students in psychology, but is also suitable
for students of the humanities and other biological or social sciences.
This audience typically has some knowledge of statistics, but rarely an
idea how data is prepared and shaped to allow for statistical testing.
By using various data types and working with many examples, we teach
tools for transforming, summarizing, and visualizing data. By keeping
our eyes open for the perils of misleading representations, the book
fosters fundamental skills of data literacy and cultivates reproducible
research practices that enable and precede any practical use of
statistics.

### Audience

Students of psychology and other social sciences are trained to analyze
data. But the data they learn to work with (e.g., in courses on
statistics and empirical research methods) is typically provided to them
and structured in a (rectangular or “tidy”) format that presupposes many
steps of data processing regarding the aggregation and spatial layout of
variables. When beginning to collect their own data, students inevitably
struggle with these pre-processing steps which — even for experienced
data scientists — tend to require more time and effort than choosing and
conducting statistical tests.

This course develops the foundations of data analysis that allow
students to collect data from real-world sources and transform and shape
such data to answer scientific and practical questions. Although there
are many good introductions to data science (e.g., [Grolemund & Wickham,
2017](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)) they typically do not take into account
the special needs — and often anxieties and reservations — of psychology
students. As social scientists are not computer scientists, we introduce
new concepts and commands without assuming a mathematical or
computational background. Adopting a task-oriented perspective, we begin
with a specific problem and then solve it with some combination of data
collection, manipulation, and visualization.

### Goals

Our main goal is to develop a set of useful skills in analyzing
real-world data and conducting reproducible research. Upon completing
this course, you will be able to use R to read, transform, analyze, and
visualize data of various types. Many interactive exercises allow
students to continuously check their understanding, practice their
skills, and monitor their progress.

### Requirements

This course assumes some basic familiarity with statistics and the
[R](https://www.R-project.org/) programming language, but enthusiastic
programming novices are also welcome.
